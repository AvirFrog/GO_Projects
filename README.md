## Info

Various projects are written in Go. Some of them are based on the book "Get Programming with Go" by Nathan Youngman and Roger Peppe. Other projects are by me. 

## The Go Playground

If you want to test the code working, paste the selected code [here](https://play.golang.com/).

**ATTENTION** - Some codes may not work properly on Go Playground. Therefore, to be sure that everything will work, use, for example, [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).
